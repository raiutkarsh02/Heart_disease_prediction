Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains code and data for predicting the risk of heart disease in individuals based on a set of input features. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques and aims to provide an early detection system for potential heart disease cases.

Data
The dataset used for training and evaluation is stored in the data directory. It consists of a CSV file named heart.csv, which contains anonymized patient information and corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

The features included in the dataset are as follows:

Age: Age of the patient in years
Sex: Gender of the patient (0 for female, 1 for male)
CP: Chest pain type (0-3)
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg
Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
FBS: Fasting blood sugar level > 120 mg/dl (0 for false, 1 for true)
Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
Exang: Exercise-induced angina (0 for no, 1 for yes)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
CA: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
Thal: Thalassemia, a blood disorder (0-3)
The target variable is the presence of heart disease, indicated by the 'target' column in the dataset (0 for no disease, 1 for disease presence).

Code
The code for building and evaluating the heart disease prediction model is provided in the code directory. The main script is heart_disease_prediction.py, which performs the following steps:

Loads the dataset from the CSV file
Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and performing feature scaling
Splits the data into training and testing sets
Trains a machine learning model on the training data
Evaluates the trained model on the testing data
Outputs the performance metrics of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Usage
To use this heart disease prediction model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Place your own dataset or use the provided heart.csv file in the data directory.
Run the heart_disease_prediction.py script to train and evaluate the model.
Review the performance metrics displayed in the console output.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different models or feature engineering techniques to further enhance the prediction accuracy.
